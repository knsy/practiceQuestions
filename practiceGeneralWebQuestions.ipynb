    " _after research:_ When standards were introduced for HTML and CSS, around the era of IE5 and Netscape, there needed to be a way for the renderer to know which specification the page was written for. For old, IE5 and Netscape pages, quirks mode is used. For all modern browsers full standards mode is used. Almost standard is declared for compatibility with very few quirks, mainly how height of certain elements is calculated. The rendering mode is inferred from the DOCTYPE specification used."
